        ''' T_CLICK_1 board has an MCP4921 (12-bit DAC) that feeds an XTR116 loop driver (voltage-to-current converter).
        This class provides a single function, `write_mA`, that considers both chips' behaviors. 
        
        Inputs: (see MCP4921 datasheet)
        gpio_cs_pin : gpio pin object used for chip select
        spi : spidev object to use for the SPI communication
        SHDNB : Shutdown Bar
        GAB : GA Bar "Output Gain Select bit"; if 1, no gain. If 0, 2x gain
            Note: V_ref on T_Click board is 4.096 V, so no gain is needed
        BUF : whether to use input buffer (limits output voltage swing) default is 0 (unbuffered)
